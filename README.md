```

## Overview

This project is an implementation of a shopping cart using TypeScript, React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Mantine. It ensures type safety and code quality with TypeScript and utilizes React for building the user interface. Vite optimizes the development and build process, while Tailwind CSS provides easy and customizable styling. Mantine offers ready-to-use components for a streamlined development experience. The project uses React's useContext for efficient state management across components. It avoids complex state management libraries and keeps the codebase clean. Additionally, a custom React hook is created to utilize local storage, enabling data persistence in the browser. This hook allows storing and retrieving data from the local storage API, which is useful for maintaining state across page refreshes and component navigation. Overall, this project combines modern technologies and libraries to create a robust and visually appealing shopping cart application with efficient state management.
